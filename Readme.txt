objective: The objective of Sokoban is to push all of the boxes onto a target cross located in the maze.

winning: You win a Sokoban level when all boxes have been pushed onto their corresponding target crosses. The level is considered solved, and you can then proceed to the next level.
Losing: mazes are solvable but it is possible to trap a box in the corner or against a wall making the level unsolvable. in this case, you have to press "Restart" to restart the level.
